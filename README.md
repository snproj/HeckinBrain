# HeckinBrain
A small website in raw HTML/CSS/JS that lets you easily encode and decode Brainheck (see Brainheck repo).

If you run `index.html`, you'll see four boxes. The top two are for encoding and decoding at maximum speed (almost instantaneous) while the bottom two are for encoding and decoding with a visualisation of the register state.

Type in `hello world` into the bottom-left box, click `SLOW CONVERT PLAINTEXT` and watch the result appear in the bottom-right box!
